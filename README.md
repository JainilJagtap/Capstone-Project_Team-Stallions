TEAM STALLIONS

Welcome to the Capstone Project Repository of the group: Team Stallions

About Our Project:
We have built a Task scheduler with Remainder functionality,in which user are allowed to manage task based on deadline or importance level. Here we have use file handling concept which is used to store task in file ,we also include different functionality like adding of task, deletion of task marking task as completed,viewing completed task,and displaying task in order of priority and giving remainder of task with highest priority .
We have also took care wherein tasks of same deadline are entered, for such cases we see the importance level of the task inputted by the user and prioritise it on the basis of importance level.
