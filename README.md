# CAPSTONE PROJECT
## TASK SCHEDULER 
### TEAM STALLIONS

Welcome to the Capstone Project Repository of the group: Team Stallions

### About Our Project:
We have built a Task scheduler with Remainder functionality, in which users are allowed to manage tasks based on deadline or importance level. Here we have used the file handling concept, which is used to store tasks in a file. We also include different functionalities like adding a task, deleting a task, marking a task as completed, viewing completed tasks, and displaying tasks in order of priority. We have also implemented a feature to give a reminder of tasks with the highest priority.
